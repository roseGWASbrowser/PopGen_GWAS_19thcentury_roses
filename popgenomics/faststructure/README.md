Note that the faststructure was used without the --cv mode because of a bug during the computation. <br>
For the use in our manuscript - validation of the population structure observed with the a PCA -, an ad hoc test was not needed. <br>
But please check that this is not happening on your own inferences, if you want to explore the pop structure on your own data with faststructure.

To convert the vcf to faststructure with PLINK, see *./script_convertvcf_for_faststructure.sh*<br>
To launch faststructure, see *./script_faststructure.sh*<br>
To plot the results, see the R script *./script_R_generatefaststructureplots.R*<br>
