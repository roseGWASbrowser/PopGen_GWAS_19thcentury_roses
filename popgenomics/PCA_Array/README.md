This script shows how the PCA was performed based on the 204 clone-corrected samples (i.e. 205 lines, considering the header). The dataset is the same than the one provided in the ./SNParray/ directory, but is also provided here for the sake of clarity.<br>
For the final version of the figure (Fig2A of the article), see the R script in this directory ./main_figures/Fig2/
